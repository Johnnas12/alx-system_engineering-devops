Title: Postmortem: Critical Outage in Web Stack

Date: 2024-05-10

Authors: Yohanes Mesfin 

Executive Summary
On 2024-05-10, a critical outage occurred in our web stack, resulting in a complete disruption of service for our users. The outage lasted approximately three hours, during which time our platform was inaccessible. This postmortem aims to provide a detailed analysis of the incident, including the root cause, impact, and the steps taken to mitigate and prevent such issues in the future.

Incident Timeline
2024-05-10, 09:00 AM: The incident began when users started reporting intermittent connectivity issues and slow response times.
2024-05-10, 09:15 AM: The operations team initiated an investigation into the issue to identify the root cause.
2024-05-10, 09:30 AM: The team discovered abnormal spikes in CPU and memory utilization on multiple servers in the web stack.
2024-05-10, 09:45 AM: The decision was made to restart the affected servers to alleviate the performance degradation.
2024-05-10, 10:00 AM: The restart process began, but it failed to bring the servers back online, exacerbating the outage.
2024-05-10, 10:30 AM: Additional engineering resources were engaged to assist in the troubleshooting process.
2024-05-10, 11:15 AM: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in a critical caching layer, causing an infinite loop and resource exhaustion.
2024-05-10, 11:30 AM: A temporary workaround was implemented to bypass the problematic caching layer and restore service.
2024-05-10, 12:00 PM: The web stack was restored to full functionality, and monitoring was put in place to detect similar issues proactively.
Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the outage was determined to be a misconfiguration in the critical caching layer of our web stack. The misconfiguration caused a circular cache dependency, resulting in an infinite loop that rapidly consumed CPU and memory resources. This led to the degradation of performance and eventual unresponsiveness of the entire platform.

The misconfiguration occurred during a recent deployment when a new caching strategy was implemented to optimize response times. Unfortunately, a configuration parameter was mistakenly set to trigger excessive cache invalidation, creating the circular dependency.

Impact and Mitigation
The outage had a severe impact on our users, resulting in a complete loss of service for approximately three hours. During this period, users were unable to access our platform, leading to frustration and potential financial losses for our customers.

To mitigate the impact of the outage and restore service, the following actions were taken:

The problematic caching layer was temporarily bypassed, allowing users to access the platform while the issue was being resolved.
Additional engineering resources were allocated to expedite the troubleshooting and resolution process.
The misconfiguration in the caching layer was identified and corrected.
The web stack was restored to full functionality, and comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure stability.
Lessons Learned and Preventive Measures
The critical outage highlighted several areas where improvements can be made to prevent similar incidents in the future:

Thorough Testing and Review Process: Strengthen the testing and review process for system configuration changes to prevent misconfigurations from reaching the production environment.
Automated Monitoring and Alerting: Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect abnormal resource utilization patterns and promptly notify the operations team.
Redundancy and Failover: Evaluate and enhance the redundancy and failover mechanisms within the web stack to minimize the impact of a single point of failure.
Disaster Recovery Planning: Develop and regularly test a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to ensure the swift recovery of services in the event of a critical outage.
Post-Incident Analysis: Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to identify areas of improvement, document lessons learned, and share them with the broader organization.
By implementing these preventive measures, we aim to strengthen our infrastructure resilience, minimize downtime, and provide a more reliable and seamless experience for our users.

Conclusion
The critical outage experienced in our web stack was a result of a misconfiguration in the caching layer. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to our users and appreciate their patience during the disruption. The incident has provided valuable insights into our system's vulnerabilities, and we are committed to implementing the necessary measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Our focus remains on providing a stable and reliable platform for our users, and we are confident that the lessons learned from this incident will contribute to achieving that goal.
